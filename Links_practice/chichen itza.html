    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about_7">Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD
        600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c.
        AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central
        Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles
        was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most
        contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural
        diffusion.

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p class="about_7">The layout of Chichen Itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation, between
        750 and 900 AD. Its final layout was developed after 900 AD, and the 10th century saw the rise of the city as a
        regional capital controlling the area from central Yucatán to the north coast, with its power extending down the
        east and west coasts of the peninsula. The earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at Chichen Itza is equivalent
        to 832 AD, while the last known date was recorded in the Osario temple in 998.
