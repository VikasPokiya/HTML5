    <p class="about_7">New7Wonders of the World was a campaign started in 2000 to choose Wonders of the World from a
        selection of 200 existing monuments. The popularity poll via free Web-based voting and small amounts of
        telephone voting was led by Canadian-Swiss Bernard Weber and organized by the New7Wonders Foundation (N7W) based
        in Zurich, Switzerland, with winners announced on 7 July 2007 in Lisbon, at Estádio da Luz. The poll was
        considered unscientific partly because it was possible for people to cast multiple votes. According to John
        Zogby, founder and current President/CEO of the Utica, New York-based polling organization Zogby International,
        New7Wonders Foundation drove "the largest poll on record".</p>
    <blockquote class="about_7">The New7Wonders Foundation, established in 2001, relied on private donations and the sale of
        broadcast rights and received no public funding. After the final announcement, New7Wonders said it didn't earn
        anything from the exercise and barely recovered its investment.</blockquote>
