    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about_7">Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْرَاء‎, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; Ancient Greek: Πέτρα, "Stone"), originally
        known to its inhabitants in Nabataean Aramaic as rqmw Raqēmō, is a historical and archaeological city in
        southern Jordan. Petra lies around Jabal Al-Madbah in a basin surrounded by mountains which form the eastern
        flank of the Arabah valley that runs from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. The area around Petra has been
        inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city
        of their kingdom, as early as the 4th century BC. However, archaeological work has only discovered evidence of
        Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The
        Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's proximity to the trade routes by establishing it as a
        major regional trading hub.

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p class="about_7">They were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater, agriculture and stone carving. Petra
        flourished in the 1st century AD, when its famous Al-Khazneh structure – believed to be the mausoleum of
        Nabataean king Aretas IV – was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.
