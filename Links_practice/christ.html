    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about_7">Christ the Redeemer is an Art Deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by
        French sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with
        French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida fashioned the face.

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p class="about_7">A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's submissions and felt building the
        structure of reinforced concrete (designed by Albert Caquot) instead of steel was more suitable for the
        cross-shaped statue. The concrete making up the base was supplied from Limhamn, Sweden. The outer layers are
        soapstone, chosen for its enduring qualities and ease of use. Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931
        and cost the equivalent of US$250,000 (equivalent to $3,600,000 in 2019) and the monument opened on October 12,
        1931. During the opening ceremony, the statue was to be lit by a battery of floodlights turned on remotely by
        Italian shortwave radio inventor Guglielmo Marconi, stationed 9,200 kilometres (5,700 mi) away in Rome but
        because of bad weather, the lights were activated on-site.
