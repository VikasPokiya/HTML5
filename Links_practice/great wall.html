    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about_7">The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ
        Chángchéng) is the collective name of a series of fortification systems generally built across the historical
        northern borders of China to protect and consolidate territories of Chinese states and empires against various
        nomadic groups of the steppe and their polities. Several walls were being built from as early as the 7th century
        BC by ancient Chinese states; selective stretches were later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the
        first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties have built and
        maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming
        dynasty (1368–1644).

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p class="about_7">The Great Wall concept was revived again under the Ming in the 14th century, and following the
        Ming army's defeat by the Oirats in the Battle of Tumu. The Ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the
        Mongolian tribes after successive battles, and the long-drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire. The Ming
        adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of China.
        Acknowledging the Mongol control established in the Ordos Desert, the wall followed the desert's southern edge
        instead of incorporating the bend of the Yellow River.
