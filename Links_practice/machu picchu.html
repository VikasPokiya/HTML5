    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about_7">Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in Peru, above the Urubamba
        River valley. Built in the 15th century and later abandoned, it’s renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone walls
        that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments and
        panoramic views. Its exact former use remains a mystery.
    </p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p class="about_7">Machu Picchu is believed (by Richard L. Burger) to be built starting 1450–1460. Construction
        appears to date from two great Inca rulers, Pachacutec Inca Yupanqui (1438–1471) and Túpac Inca Yupanqui
        (1472–1493). There is a consensus among archaeologists that Pachacutec ordered the construction of the royal
        estate for himself, most likely after a successful military campaign. Though Machu Picchu is considered to be a
        "royal" estate, surprisingly, it would not have been passed down in the line of succession. Rather it was used
        for 80 years before being abandoned, seemingly because of the Spanish Conquests in other parts of the Inca
        Empire. It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the
        Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area.
