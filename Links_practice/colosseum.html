    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about_7">The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin:
        Amphitheatrum Flavium; Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio or Colosseo, is an oval
        amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. Built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and
        brick-faced concrete, it was the largest amphitheatre ever built at the time and held 50,000 to 80,000
        spectators. The Colosseum is just east of the Roman Forum. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD
        72[2] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during
        the reign of Domitian (81–96). These three emperors are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre
        was named in Latin for its association with their family name (Flavius).

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <p class="about_7">Construction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the First
        Jewish–Roman War in 70 CE led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the
        site, "the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty."
        It is often assumed that Jewish prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive
        workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheatre, but there is no ancient evidence for that; it would,
        nonetheless, be commensurate with Roman practice to add humiliation to the defeated population. Along with this
        free source of unskilled labor, teams of professional Roman builders, engineers, artists, painters and
        decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum.
