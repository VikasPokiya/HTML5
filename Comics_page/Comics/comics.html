    <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold;">India has a long tradition of comic readership and themes associated with extensive
        mythologies and folk-tales have appeared as children's comic books for decades. Indian comics often have large
        publication. The comic industry was at its peak in the late 1980s and early 1990s and during this period popular
        comics were easily sold more than 500,000 copies over the course of its shelf life of several weeks. Currently,
        it only sell around 50,000 copies over a similar period. India's once-flourishing comic industry is in sharp
        decline because ofincreasing competition from satellite television (children's television channels) and the
        gaming industry.

    <p style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold;">The history of American comics started in 1842 with the U.S. publication of Rodolphe TÃ¶pffer's work The
        Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck, but the medium was initially developed through comic strips in daily
        newspapers. The seminal years of comic strips established its canonical features (e.g., speech balloons) and
        initial genres (family strips, adventure tales). Comic-strip characters became national celebrities, and were
        subject to cross-media adaptation, while newspapers competed for the most popular artists.
